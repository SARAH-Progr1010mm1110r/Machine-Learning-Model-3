# Machine-Learning-Model-3
**Create a logistic regression model for the classification of a target variable**


# **Option 1 [Challenging]**
### Use the tips dataset and apply a logistic regression model to the tips dataset. Bin a continuous variable (tips column into 3 different categories).

* Your 3 categories for your continuous variable will be:

   * Bad Tipper
   * Good Tipper
   * Excellent Tipper

* Create a linear regression that predicts the tips column as well.

* Compare your results from the linear and logistic regression.
